<h3>The "Design and Implementation of Lost and Found Management System" aims to address the 
challenges associated with managing lost and found items in an organized manner. 
The system is designed to streamline the process of reporting, and recovering lost items 
within the Federal University of Kashere, Gombe State. 
This project involves developing a user-friendly web application that allows users to report lost items, search for found items, 
and communicate with relevant authorities to reclaim their belongings. The system has a robust database to store item information, a search functionality to facilitate easy retrieval, and an administrative module for managing records. By leveraging this system, the institutions can significantly reduce the time and effort required to manage lost and found items, 
thereby improving overall efficiency and user satisfaction.</h3>
